# Projects

* [Predicting Used Car Prices](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Predicting_used_cars_price) - Python (Sklearn, Feature_Engine, Flask), HTML, CSS
  - Built a web application using Flask that lets users input car features to get an estimate of its selling price based on a Machine Learning model trained on data collected from a popular french ad site
  - Production code available on a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Estimateur_prix_voiture)
  - Web application deployed on [Heroku](https://estimateur-prix-voiture.herokuapp.com/)

<br>

* [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis) - Python: Tweepy, BERT, Transformers, TextBlob, WordCloud
  - Conducted a sentiment analysis from tweets referring to the release of a new video game

<br>

* [Using Deep Learning to Identify Dog Breeds](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Dog_Breed_Classification) - Python: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
  - Built a CNN using transfer learning to be able to estimate the breed of a dog and, if given an image of a human, detect what type of dog the human looks like.


<br>

* [IMDb - EDA of a large dataset](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/IMDb_data_analysis) - SSIS, MSSQL, Python, Tableau
  - Imported IMDb data onto a local database using SSIS and MSSQL, explored the data through queries, python code and by using Tableau visualizations

<br>

* [Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/SalesForecasting) - Python (Sklearn, LIME, Pickle), Tableau
  - Conducted time series analysis on sales and conducted sales forecasting

<br>

* [Predicting Customer Churn](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/CustomerChurn) - Python: Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Pickle, LIME, SMOTE
  - Used a ML model to detect customers likely to churn and understand why they are likely to churn
 

<br>

* [Disaster Response (Multiouput Classification)](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Disaster_Response) - Python (NLTK, Flask, Sklearn), Plotly, HTML, CSS
  - This multioutput classification project aims to analyze and classify messages to improve communication during disasters. Additionally, a web application can be run locally after setting up the required environment.

# Medium Articles
* [Guide to creating interactive visualizations in Python](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/guide-to-creating-interactive-visualizations-in-python-78f79ffc7d61)
  - In this guide, we explore HoloViz tools, and most precisely, we take a look at Panel and hvPlot which are open-source libraries that can be used to create interactive charts and dashboards. We also see how easy is to deploy and share our dashboard using a Jupyter Notebook.
  - Dashboard with interactive charts deployed on [Heroku](https://pokeviz.herokuapp.com/)
  - The code used to create this guide is available here, on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/PokemonDashboard)


* [Analyzing the results of an A/B test](https://medium.com/@pcmaldonado/starbucks-take-home-assignment-a8b647fb21e0)
  - Analysis of the results of an A/B test where the final objective is to build a ML model in order to optimize a promotion strategy to better target customers.
  - The code used is available here, on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/StarbucksAssignment)

* [Explaining Black-Box models in Python](https://medium.com/@pcmaldonado/simple-guide-to-interpreting-black-box-models-in-python-5c8bb3b5fcae)
  - A quick look at different global and local methods for explaining complex machine learning models using Python libraries
  - The code used to create this guide is available here, on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/ExplainingBlackBoxModels)

* [Linear Regression: Normal Equation & Gradient Descent â€” from Scratch](https://medium.com/@pcmaldonado/linear-regression-normal-equation-gradient-descent-from-scratch-dc8c0f51940)
  - Studies linear regression, how to find optimal weights using the normal equation and its drawbacks, as well as using gradient descent (Batch, Stochastic and Mini-Batch), from scratch using mostly NumPy
  - The code used to create this guide is available here, on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Linear_Regression_from_Scratch)
